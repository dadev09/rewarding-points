## About the App

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase. A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points). Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, create an app to calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.

In this app, there are three tables - all transaction table, monthly awarded points by customer table, and totally awarded points by customer table.

In each table header, there is a print button to download table data in json format.
